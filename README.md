## 1. Git and GitHub 
Okay, GIT knowledge was completely new to me, at first it was difficult to turn all theoretical knowledge into practical attempts to push the task, but over time I figured it out, let's move on

## 2. Linux CLI, and HTTP
It was not difficult to work with the Linux command line, everything is clear, I did not pass the more difficult levels, since it was stated that it is better to have experience working with it, so I also think that I will not remember that knowledge at the moment, I will return to it later . I taught about web protocols before that, but now I repeated everything.
